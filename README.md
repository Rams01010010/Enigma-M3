# Enigma-M3
This was the cryptographic device used in WWII and this program works on that principle.

## Enigma Settings
  - ##Rotors : 
    There are totally 5 rotors(I/II/III/IV/V) in this model and you can choose 3 rotors, in which order they need to be arranged (Left to Right).
    
  - Reflector:
    There are 2 reflectors(B/C) in this model and you can choose one.
    
  - Ring Setting : 
    You can choose at what ring position of the ring the rotors should aligned (if 'C D F' then 'C' of ring1 will be aligned with 'A' of rotor1 and so on).
    
  - Plugboard :
    You can use pair of letters seperated by a space to indicate plugboard(if AB then 'A' will be mapped to 'B' & viceversa).
    
  - Initial Position:
    This is the position of the rotor after setting the machine.

## Finally !
 Enter the settings you need and you're done and you can 'start' and encrypt your messages :)
